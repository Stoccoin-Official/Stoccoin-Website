# Blockchain and Cryptocurrency

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a technology that enables the secure sharing of information. Transactions are recorded in an account book called a ledger. A blockchain is a type of distributed database or ledger. The power to update a blockchain is distributed between the nodes, or participants, of a public or private computer network. This is known as _distributed ledger technology_, or DLT. Nodes are incentivized with digital tokens or currency to make updates to blockchains.
Blockchain allows for the permanent, immutable, and transparent recording of data and transactions. This, in turn, makes it possible to exchange anything that has value, whether that is a physical item or something less tangible.

A blockchain has three central attributes:

1. First, a blockchain database must be **cryptographically secure**. In order to access or add data on the database, you need two cryptographic keys: a _public key_, which is basically the address in the database, and the _private key_, which is a personal key that must be authenticated by the network.
2. Next, a blockchain is a digital log or database of transactions, meaning it happens **fully online**.
3. And finally, a blockchain is a database that is **shared across a public or private network**.
   > One of the most well-known public blockchain networks is the _Bitcoin blockchain_. Anyone can open a Bitcoin wallet or become a node on the network. Other blockchains may be private networks. These are more applicable to banking and fintech, where people need to know exactly who is participating, who has access to data, and who has a private key to the database. Other types of blockchains include _consortium blockchains_ and _hybrid blockchains_, both of which combine different aspects of public and private blockchains.

## How does Blockchain work?

A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called blocks. These blocks are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a _cryptographic hash_ of the previous block, a _timestamp_, and _transaction data_.

The blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a block, like a cell in a spreadsheet. Once it is full, the information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the hash.

The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in the block. This creates a series of blocks that are chained together. Altering any one block will cause alteration of all subsequent blocks, indicating a breach in security. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid. Therefore, blockchain technology is considered highly secure and protects against tampering, fraud and cybercrime. It also saves time and costs as transactions do not need to be verified or overseen by a central authority.

> Blockchain technology is considered a major part of Web 3.0 development. Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. It goes by the motto of 'Read-Write-Own'.

## Introduction to Cryptocurrencies

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology.
A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.  
They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.

Some popular cryptocurrencies:

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):**
   Bitcoin was the world’s first cryptocurrency, with its origins dating back to 2008, and remains the best-known type of crypto. In January 2022, Bitcoin was the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, at US $896 billion.
2. **Ether (ETH):**
   Ether is the cryptocurrency that runs on the _Ethereum_ blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, Ether is uncapped, meaning that an infinite number of coins can theoretically be created. Ethereum also supports **smart contracts**, which are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain and are executed automatically when certain conditions are met.
3. **Binance Coin (BNB):**
   Binance Coin is native to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange as of 2021. To ensure its value remains stable, Binance destroys or “burns” a fixed percentage of the coins in circulation.
4. **Tether (USDT):**
   Tether is a type of _stablecoin_, designed to have a less-volatile price by being linked to an external asset. In this case, each coin is backed by an equivalent number of US dollars, which keeps it from experiencing the same kind of pricing volatility that other cryptocurrencies face.
5. **Solana (SOL):**
   SOL is the native coin of the Solana platform, which functions on a blockchain system, just like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Solana’s network can perform a whopping 50,000 transactions per second, making this platform especially attractive to investors looking to trade quickly.

## Pros and Cons of Investing in Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation.

Some advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrencies are as follows:

### Advantages:

1. **Removes single points of failure.** In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties.
2. **Easier to transfer funds between parties**
3. **Removes third parties**
4. **Can be used to generate returns.** Cryptocurrency investments can generate profits. Cryptocurrency markets have skyrocketed in value over the past decade, at one point reaching almost $2 trillion.
5. **Remittances are streamlined.** Cryptocurrencies serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. A fiat currency is converted to Bitcoin, transferred across borders, and subsequently converted to the destination fiat currency. This method streamlines the money transfer process and makes it cheaper.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Transactions are pseudonymous.** Though they claim to be an anonymous form of transaction, they leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can investigate. This opens up the possibility that governments and authorities (and others) can track financial transactions.
2. **Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses**
3. **Have become highly centralized.** In theory, cryptocurrencies are meant to be decentralized, their wealth distributed between many parties on a blockchain. In reality, ownership is highly concentrated. For example, just 100 addresses hold roughly 12% of circulating bitcoin and total value.
4. **Off-chain security issues.** Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked.
5. **Prices are very volatile**
