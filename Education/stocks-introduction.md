# What Are Stocks?
A stock, also known as *equity*, is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of the issuing corporation. Units of stock are called "shares" which entitles the owner to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own.   
Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges and are the foundation of many individual investors' portfolios. Stock trades have to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from fraudulent practices.

## Stocks as Investment Vehicles
> Stocks are perhaps beneficial in raising the capital appreciation. It happens when the price of a stock increases. Another advantage of investing in stocks is the shareholders usually receive profits in the form of dividends. Dividend payments are made when a corporation gives stockholders a portion of its earnings. Investing in stocks also gives the possibility to vote on shares. Companies sell stock to raise funds for a range of purposes, which may include; settling debt, introducing new goods, developing in new markets or areas and developing new facilities or expanding existing ones. 

## Benefits of Owning Stocks
1. **Claim on assets**   
A shareholder has a claim on assets of a company it has stock in. However, the claims on assets are relevant only when the company faces liquidation. 
<!-- In that event, all of the company’s assets and liabilities are counted, and after all creditors are paid, the shareholders can claim what is left. This is the reason that equity (stocks) investments are considered higher risk than debt (credit, loans, and bonds) because creditors are paid before equity holders, and if there are no assets left after the debt is paid, the equity holders may receive nothing. -->

2. **Dividends and capital gains**  
A stockholder may also receive earnings, which are paid in the form of dividends. Aside from dividends, the stockholder can also enjoy capital gains from stock price appreciation.
<!-- The company can decide the amount of dividends to be paid in one period (such as one quarter or one year), or it can decide to retain all of the earnings to expand the business further.  --> 

3. **Power to vote**  
Another powerful feature of stock ownership is that shareholders are entitled to vote for management changes if the company is mismanaged. Should investors and stockholders disagree with the company’s future plans, they have the power to negotiate changes in business strategy.

4. **Limited liability**  
Lastly, when a person owns shares of a company, the nature of ownership is limited. Should the company go bankrupt, shareholders are not personally liable for any loss.

## Risks of Owning Stock

1. **Loss of capital**  
There is no guarantee that a stock’s price will move up. An investor may buy shares at $50 during an IPO, but find that the shares move down to $20 as the company begins to perform badly, for example.

2. **No liquidation preference**  
When a company liquidates, creditors are paid before equity holders. In most cases, a company will only liquidate when it has very little assets left to operate. In most cases, that means that there will be no assets left for equity holders once creditors are paid off.

3. **Irrelevant power to vote**  
While retail investors technically have voting rights in executive board meetings, in practice they usually have very limited influence or power. The majority shareholder typically determines the outcome of all votes at shareholder meetings.

## Basic Stock Market Terminology
Whether you are a budding or seasoned stock investor, knowledge of the basic terms used in the stock market is necessary. Here is a glossary of basic terms that you need to know as an investor:

* **Agent:**
An agent is a stock brokerage firm which does the buying/selling of shares on behalf of the investor in the stock market. 
* **Ask/Offer:**
It refers to the lowest price at which the owner of the equity share is willing to sell the share in the stock market.
* **Broker:**
A person who purchases or sells investments/stocks on behalf of the investor/trader in return for a commission.
* **Bear Market:**
It refers to a period in which the prices of equity shares fall consistently. It’s usually a condition where share prices fall by 20% from recent hghs.
* **Bull Market:**
An opposite of the bear market, a bull market is a market where the prices of the stocks are increasing over a prolonged period of time. A single stock and a sector can be bullish at one time and bearish at another time.
* **Beta:**
It measures the association between the price of an equity share and the overall movement of the stock market. Beta of the market is assumed to be 1. A stock’s beta of more than 1 shows a higher risk than the market. A beta of less than 1 shows that stock is less riskier than the market or it would fall lower as compared to the market. 
* **Blue Chip Stock:**
These are equity shares of companies which are well-established and financially stable. These generally have a relatively high market capitalization.
* **Bonds:**
A bond is a fixed income investment which is issued by the government or a company to its buyers. It shows a specified amount which an investor lends to the issuer of the bond for a specified period of time at a variable or fixed interest rate called the coupon rate.

It is a form of fixed-income instrument which is not backed by security of any physical assets or collateral of the issuer.
* **Delta:**
A delta relates to the ratio of change in the price of a derivative in response to change in the price of the underlying asset. A higher delta suggests higher sensitivity to the price changes of the underlying asset.
* **Spread:**
It refers to the difference between the bid and the ask prices of an equity share. You may perceive it as the difference between the amount at which you would like to buy and the amount at which you would like to sell a stock.
* **Volatility:**
It refers to the fluctuations in the price of an equity share. Highly volatile stocks witness severe ups and downs during trading sessions. These are highly risky bets which can bring huge profits for the skilled trader. However, stocks may crash in a short time and extreme volatility could result in a severe loss. 
* **Dividend Yield:**
It shows how much a company or firm pays out in dividends every year as compared to the stock price.
