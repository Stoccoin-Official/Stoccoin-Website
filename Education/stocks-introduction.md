# Introduction to Stocks
## What are stocks?
**Stocks**, also known as **shares** or **equities**, are financial instruments that represent ownership in a publicly traded company. 

When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder and acquire a small ownership stake in that company.

## Why companies issue stocks?
Companies issue stocks to raise capital for various purposes such as **expanding operations**, **investing in new projects**, or **paying off debt**. 

By selling shares of their ownership, companies can raise funds from individual and institutional investors who are willing to invest in their growth potential.

# Stock Market
Stock market is a place where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies.The stock market allows individuals and institutions to participate in the growth and success of companies by investing their money.

## Key Terminology
Before diving into the world of stock, it is essential to familiarize  yourself with some key terminology.

### 1. Stock
A stock represents a share of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner of that company.

### 2. Publicly Traded Company
A publicly traded company is a business that has issued shares of its stock to the public, allowing anyone to buy and sell those shares on a stock exchange.

### 3. Stock Exchange
A stock exchange is a regulated marketplace where buyers and sellers come together to trade stocks. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ.

### 4. Ticker Symbol
Each publicly traded company has a unique ticker symbol, which is a combination of letters representing the company's stock. Ticker symbols are used to identify and trade stocks.

## How stocks function as investment vehicles?

### 1. Capital Appreciation
When you invest in stocks, you have the opportunity to benefit from capital appreciation. If the value of the company and its stock increase over time, the price of the stock may rise, allowing you to sell it at a higher price and make a profit.

### 2. Dividends
Some companies share a portion of their profits with shareholders through dividends. Dividends are regular payments made to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis, and are based on the company's earnings. Not all companies pay dividends, so it's important to research a company's dividend policy before investing.

### 3. Risk and Volatility
 Investing in stocks comes with risks. Stock prices can fluctuate daily based on various factors such as company performance, economic conditions, and market sentiment. Stocks can experience both gains and losses, so it's important to assess your risk tolerance and have a long-term investment perspective.

 ### 4. Diversification
 Diversification is a risk management strategy that involves spreading your investments across different stocks and asset classes. By diversifying your portfolio, you can potentially reduce risk because the performance of one stock may not significantly impact your entire investment.

 ### 5. Research and Analysis
  Successful investing in stocks requires research and analysis. It's important to understand the company's financial health, management team, competitive landscape, and industry trends. This information can help you make informed investment decisions.


> Remember, investing in stocks involves risk, and it's crucial to do your due diligence and seek professional advice if needed. The stock market can provide opportunities for growth and wealth creation, but it's important to approach it with a long-term perspective and a well-informed investment strategy.

# Stock Exchanges

Stock exchanges are regulated marketplaces where buyers and sellers come together to trade stocks, bonds, and other securities. They provide a platform for companies to list their shares and for investors to buy and sell those shares. Stock exchanges play a crucial role in facilitating the functioning and transparency of the financial markets.

## Key features and functions of stock exchanges

### 1. Trading Platform
Stock exchanges provide a centralized trading platform where buyers and sellers can execute trades. They establish rules and regulations governing the trading process to ensure fair and orderly transactions.

### 2. Listing Requirements
Companies must meet specific criteria to list their shares on a stock exchange. These requirements typically include factors such as financial performance, market capitalization, number of shareholders, and corporate governance standards. Listing on a stock exchange provides companies with increased visibility and access to capital.

### 3. Price Discovery
Stock exchanges facilitate price discovery by bringing together buyers and sellers. Through continuous trading, supply and demand dynamics determine the prices at which stocks are bought and sold. This process helps establish fair market values for securities.

### 4. Market Regulation
Stock exchanges enforce regulations and oversight to maintain the integrity of the marketplace. They monitor trading activities, ensure compliance with listing rules, and investigate any irregularities or market abuses. Market regulators work in conjunction with stock exchanges to safeguard investor interests and maintain market stability.

### 5. Market Indices
Stock exchanges calculate and maintain market indices, such as the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100, which track the performance of specific groups of stocks. These indices serve as benchmarks, providing insights into the overall market performance and allowing investors to gauge the performance of their portfolios.

### 6. Liquidty and Market Depth
Stock exchanges provide liquidity by offering a platform where buyers and sellers can easily transact. A liquid market ensures that there is sufficient trading activity and a robust market depth, allowing investors to buy or sell securities without significant price fluctuations.
