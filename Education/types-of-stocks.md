# Stocks

Stocks, also known as shares or equities, represent ownership in a company. There are various types of stocks that investors can trade on the stock market.

# Types of Stocks

## 1. Common Stocks

Common stocks are the most widely held type of stock. When people refer to "stocks," they usually mean common stocks. Owning common stock gives shareholders voting rights and the opportunity to participate in the company's growth and profits through dividends and capital appreciation. However, common stockholders are the last to receive any remaining assets if the company goes bankrupt.

### Characteristics

Common stocks represent ownership in a company and offer voting rights and potential dividends. Investors have the opportunity to participate in the company's growth and success.

### Risks

Common stocks are exposed to market volatility and can experience price fluctuations. In the event of bankruptcy, common stockholders are the last to receive any remaining assets.

### Potential Benefits

Common stocks have the potential for capital appreciation and long-term growth. They offer the opportunity to benefit from a company's success and may provide dividend income.

### Examples of Common Stocks

| Company               | Ticker Symbol |
| :-------------------- | :------------ |
| Apple Inc.            | AAPL          |
| Microsoft Corporation | MSFT          |
| Amazon.com, Inc.      | AMZN          |
| Alphabet Inc.         | GOOGL         |
| Facebook, Inc.        | FB            |

## 2. Preferred Stocks

Preferred stocks have characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Preferred shareholders have a higher claim on the company's assets and earnings compared to common shareholders. They usually receive fixed dividends, which are paid before any dividends are distributed to common shareholders. Preferred stockholders do not have voting rights in most cases.

### Characteristics

Preferred stocks have characteristics of both stocks and bonds. They offer higher claim on company assets and fixed dividend payments.

### Risks

Preferred stocks may have limited or no voting rights, and their dividends can be suspended by the company. They are subject to interest rate and credit risk.

### Potential Benefits

Preferred stocks offer stable dividend income and can be attractive to income-oriented investors seeking regular payouts. They generally have less price volatility compared to common stocks.

### Examples of Preferred Stocks

| Company                                        | Ticker Symbol |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| JPMorgan Chase & Co. Preferred Series P        | JPM.PRB       |
| Coca-Cola Company Preferred Series A           | KO.PRA        |
| Wells Fargo & Company Preferred Series T       | WFC.PRT       |
| Bank of America Corporation Preferred Series Y | BAC.PRY       |
| Verizon Communications Inc. Preferred Series C | VZ.PRC        |

## 3. Growth Stocks

Growth stocks belong to companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market. These stocks generally do not pay substantial dividends since the companies reinvest their profits into further expansion and development. Investors buy growth stocks with the expectation that the stock price will appreciate significantly over time.

### Characteristics

Growth stocks belong to companies expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to others. They typically reinvest their profits for expansion rather than paying dividends.

### Risks

Growth stocks can be volatile and subject to market swings. The company's growth expectations may not materialize, leading to a decline in stock prices.

### Fundamental Benefits

Growth stocks have the potential for significant capital appreciation. If the company meets or exceeds growth expectations, investors can benefit from rising stock prices.

### Examples of growth stocks

| Company                         | Ticker Symbol |
| :------------------------------ | :------------ |
| Tesla, Inc.                     | TSLA          |
| Netflix, Inc.                   | NFLX          |
| NVIDIA Corporation              | NVDA          |
| Square, Inc.                    | SQ            |
| Zoom Video Communications, Inc. | ZM            |

## 4. Value Stocks

Value stocks are shares of companies that are considered undervalued based on various financial metrics, such as the price-to-earnings ratio or price-to-book ratio. These stocks tend to have stable and mature businesses, and investors believe that their true value is not reflected in the current market price. Value stocks often pay dividends and are sought by investors looking for stable returns.

### Characteristics

Value stocks are considered undervalued based on financial metrics. They often belong to stable and mature companies with a history of generating consistent earnings.

### Risks

Value stocks may experience extended periods of underperformance. The undervaluation may persist if the market fails to recognize the company's value.

### Potentail Benefits

Value stocks can offer potential capital appreciation as the market corrects the perceived undervaluation. They may also provide dividend income and are considered less volatile compared to growth stocks.

### Example of value stocks

| Company                                     | Ticker Symbol |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------ |
| Johnson & Johnson                           | JNJ           |
| Procter & Gamble Company                    | PG            |
| Exxon Mobil Corporation                     | XOM           |
| International Business Machines Corporation | IBM           |
| General Electric Company                    | GE            |

## 5. Dividend Stocks

Dividend stocks are shares of companies that regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends. Dividends are typically paid in cash, although some companies offer dividends in the form of additional shares. Dividend stocks are favored by income-oriented investors who seek a steady stream of income from their investments.

### Characteristics

Dividend stocks regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends. They are often established companies with stable cash flows.

### Risks

Dividend stocks can be impacted by changes in interest rates, company financials, or economic conditions. Dividends are not guaranteed and can be reduced or eliminated.

### Potential Benefits

Dividend stocks provide a regular stream of income, making them attractive to income-focused investors. They can offer stability and potential for long-term growth.

### Examples of dividend stocks

| Company                  | Ticker Symbol |
| :----------------------- | :------------ |
| Coca-Cola Company        | KO            |
| Johnson & Johnson        | JNJ           |
| Procter & Gamble Company | PG            |
| AT&T Inc.                | T             |
| McDonald's Corporation   | MCD           |

## Small-Cap, Mid-Cap, and Large-Cap Stocks

Stocks can be categorized based on the market capitalization of the company. The classification can affect the risk and growth potential associated with the stock.

### Small-Cap Stocks

Small-cap stocks belong to smaller companies with a market capitalization typically below $2 billion.

Example - Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (LSCC)

### Mid-Cap Stocks

Mid-cap stocks belong to companies with a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion.

Example - Etsy, Inc. (ETSY)

### Large-Cap Stocks

Large-cap stocks belong to well-established, larger companies with a market capitalization above $10 billion.

Example - Apple Inc. (AAPL)

### Characteristics

These categories are based on a company's market capitalization (market value). Small-cap stocks belong to smaller companies, mid-cap stocks to medium-sized companies, and large-cap stocks to well-established and larger companies.

### Risks

Small-cap stocks can be more volatile and have higher risk compared to larger-cap stocks. Mid-cap stocks offer a balance between growth potential and risk. Large-cap stocks may have slower growth but are generally more stable.

### Potentail Benefits

Small-cap stocks can offer higher growth potential, mid-cap stocks can provide a balance between growth and stability, and large-cap stocks often provide stability and dividends.

> **Note** : These are just a few types of stocks, and the stock market offers a wide range of investment opportunities with different characteristics and risk profiles. Investors should conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making investment decisions.
