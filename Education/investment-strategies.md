Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves regularly investing a fixed amount of money into stocks or cryptocurrencies at predetermined intervals. Key principles and considerations include:

- **Consistent Investments**: Invest a fixed amount on a regular basis, regardless of market conditions. This approach helps reduce the impact of short-term market fluctuations.
